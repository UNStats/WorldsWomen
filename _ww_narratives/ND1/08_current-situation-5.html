<p><strong>Women are better represented in support management functions than in more strategic managerial posts</strong>
</p>

<p>
    The glass ceiling at senior managerial levels has created occupational segregation within management functions. As
    of
    2018, even though 63% of surveyed enterprises had at least one female middle manager and close to 50% of surveyed
    enterprises had at least one female senior manager, when looking at their functional responsibilities, women were
    overrepresented in support management functions, such as human resources, finance and administration, while
    managerial
    posts in the areas of research and development and profit-and-loss management, which are considered to be more
    strategic, were generally occupied by men.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>
