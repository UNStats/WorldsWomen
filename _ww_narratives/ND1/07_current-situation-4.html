<p>The finding that fewer women than men are represented at the higher levels of management is also supported by an ILO
    survey conducted in 2018,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> which collected a sample of almost 13,000 companies
    in 70 countries across five regions:
    sub-Saharan Africa; Asia and the Pacific; Europe and Central Asia; Latin America and the Caribbean; and the Middle
    East
    and Northern Africa.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>
<p>The survey showed that more than 60% of companies had at
    least one woman in supervisory, junior
    or
    administrative management and middle management. However, at the senior echelons, there were very few women: only
    48% of
    companies had at least one woman in senior management, and less than a third had women in top executive positions
    (see
    figure IV).
