<h1>Company size and share of female CEOs: it is unclear how the size of a company affects the chances that a woman will
    be
    a CEO</h1>

<p>


    The link between the size of a company and the likelihood that it will have a woman as CEO is not straightforward.
    While
    large companies have higher profiles, and may thus be less likely to discriminate against women candidates for top
    managerial positions, they also tend to be more hierarchical, making it more difficult for women to reach those
    positions as they may fall behind men in terms of networks, training and relevant job experience.<span
