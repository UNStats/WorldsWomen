<p>Gender diversity in managerial positions, as evidenced by greater representation of women in senior roles, as CEOs
    and
    senior-level managers, is not just about human rights and social equality. A number of studies have shown that a
    higher
    proportion of women in decision-making roles in the private sector has had a positive effect, boosting stock market
    returns and creating superior corporate profitability.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>
<p>A global survey of enterprises conducted by ILO in 2018
    reaffirmed that company profits increase as a result of gender diversity and equality initiatives.<span
        class="footnote-index">3</span> Nevertheless, the
    proportion of women in managerial positions remains low in both the public and private sectors, and the number of
    women
    fall as they move up the corporate ladder towards the top executive positions.
