<h1>Current situation</h1>
<p><strong>Women continue to be underrepresented among senior-level civil servants.</strong></p>
<p>
    Women tend to be underrepresented among senior-level civil servants, including government administrators,
    administrators
    at intergovernmental organizations, ambassadors and consuls-general. During the period 2008–2017, the representation
    of
    women at senior-level civil servant positions was below parity in 60% of the 27 developed countries with available
    data
    (see figure I).</p>

<p>As in the past,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> rates of representation varied widely across
    countries, ranging from 16% to 77%.
    Among
    the four countries with the highest proportions of women as senior-level civil servants (above 60%), Hungary
    (76.6%),
    the Russian Federation (61.5%), Bulgaria (61.1%) and Latvia (72%), only the latter exceeded 60% of female
    representation
    for the first time. Women’s representation among senior-level civil servants is the lowest, below 20%, in Belgium
    (17.2%) and Luxembourg (16.1%).</p>
