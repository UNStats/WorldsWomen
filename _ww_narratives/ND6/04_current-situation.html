<h1>Current situation</h1>
<p>
    <strong>In 2020, women are free under the law to participate in political activity in all countries worldwide,
        although
        significant obstacles to their effective access to parliament remain.</strong></p>
<p>Women face discrimination within
    the family, the
    economy and society, as well as under the law. A male-dominated political culture, persisting gender stereotypes
    that
    confine women to the private sphere, unequal access to resources and education, unequal social and legal status and
    violence and harassment perpetrated against women in politics and as aspirants to political office need to be
    tackled in
    order to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to access political office.<span

<p>As emphasized by the
    Inter-Parliamentary Union, increasing attention has been paid to instances of sexism, harassment and gender-based
    violence against women parliamentarians that may dissuade other women from pursuing a political career and undermine
    the
    full participation of women elected to parliament in decision-making processes.<span class="footnote-index">6</span>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Despite these challenges, there has been a continuous improvement in womenâ€™s access to parliament, with slow
        but steady progress in representation over the past 25 years.</strong> From 1995 to 2020, the proportion of
    parliamentary successive 5-year span, reaching a growth rate of 3.2% between 2010 and 2015. However, from 2015 and
    2020, the rate of increase slowed down to 2.7% (see figure I).
