    <strong>From the regional perspective, major milestones have been achieved in recent years in <span
            class="label-ref">Australia and New
            Zealand</span>,
        <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> and <span class="label-ref">Europe and Northern
            America</span>.</strong> In 2017, Australia and New
    Zealand surpassed
    the 30% mark in the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women for the second time, after first reaching that
    threshold in 2010. In 2019, Latin America and the Caribbean became the second region to surpass the 30% mark,
    followed
    by the Europe and Northern America region in 2020.

<p>In 2020, the share of women in national parliaments was the highest in Australia and New Zealand (35.1%), followed by
    Latin America and the Caribbean (32.1%), Europe and Northern America (31%) and Central Asia (25.4%). The other
    regions
    were below the global average, significantly so in Western Asia (15.6%), Southern Asia (17.3%), South-Eastern Asia
    (20.4%) and Eastern Asia (21.6%). Moreover, although minor improvements have been noted over time, the lowest share
    of
    women in parliament, 6.2%, continues to be in the <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> region, excluding Australia
    and New Zealand.</p>
