    Few women in politics reach the higher echelons of parliamentary hierarchies, particularly at the top levels as
    president or speaker of the house. Once elected, women parliamentarians need to hold positions of power and
    authority
    and participate in committee work if they are to influence policy direction. They also need to be positive role
    models
    for other women, work to change parliamentary procedures and, ultimately, support womenâ€™s rights and pursue gender
    equality (see table 2). </p>
