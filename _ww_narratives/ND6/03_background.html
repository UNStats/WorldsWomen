<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    Women’s representation in national parliaments and in key decision-making positions in parliament is an essential
    aspect
    of their participation in political and public life: their representation is a human right and a prerequisite for
    genuine democracy,<span class="footnote-index">1</span> sustainable development and peace.<span
        class="footnote-index">2</span> The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women
    contributes to good governance and gender equality in society.
</p>
<p>A stronger presence of women in parliament and in
    parliamentary leadership allows for the prominent placement of their concerns on political agendas, and for the
    introduction of fresh priorities through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws relevant to women’s
    issues.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> The full political participation of women requires that
    they occupy key positions of influence, as
    envisioned by
    the Plan of Action for Gender-sensitive Parliaments adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 2012.<span
