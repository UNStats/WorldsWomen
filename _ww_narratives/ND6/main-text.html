<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    Women’s representation in national parliaments and in key decision-making positions in parliament is an essential
    aspect
    of their participation in political and public life: their representation is a human right and a prerequisite for
    genuine democracy,<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn1"></a> sustainable development and peace.<a
        aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn2"></a> The inclusion of the perspectives and interests of women
    contributes to good governance and gender equality in society. A stronger presence of women in parliament and in
    parliamentary leadership allows for the prominent placement of their concerns on political agendas, and for the
    introduction of fresh priorities through the adoption and implementation of policies and laws relevant to women’s
    issues.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn3"></a> The full political participation of women requires that
    they occupy key positions of influence, as
    envisioned by
    the Plan of Action for Gender-sensitive Parliaments adopted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union in 2012.<a
        aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn4"></a></p>

<h1>Current situation</h1>
<p>
    <strong>In 2020, women are free under the law to participate in political activity in all countries worldwide,
        although
        significant obstacles to their effective access to parliament remain.</strong> Women face discrimination within
    the family, the
    economy and society, as well as under the law. A male-dominated political culture, persisting gender stereotypes
    that
    confine women to the private sphere, unequal access to resources and education, unequal social and legal status and
    violence and harassment perpetrated against women in politics and as aspirants to political office need to be
    tackled in
    order to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to access political office.<a
        aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn5"></a> As emphasized by the
    Inter-Parliamentary Union, increasing attention has been paid to instances of sexism, harassment and gender-based
    violence against women parliamentarians that may dissuade other women from pursuing a political career and undermine
    the
    full participation of women elected to parliament in decision-making processes.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        href="#fn6"></a>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Despite these challenges, there has been a continuous improvement in women’s access to parliament, with slow
        but steady progress in representation over the past 25 years.</strong> From 1995 to 2020, the proportion of
    parliamentary successive 5-year span, reaching a growth rate of 3.2% between 2010 and 2015. However, from 2015 and
    2020, the rate

<p>
    <strong>From the regional perspective, major milestones have been achieved in recent years in <span
            class="label-ref">Australia and New
            Zealand</span>,
        <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span> and <span class="label-ref">Europe and Northern
            America</span>.</strong> In 2017, Australia and New
    Zealand surpassed
    the 30% mark in the proportion of parliamentary seats held by women for the second time, after first reaching that
    threshold in 2010. In 2019, Latin America and the Caribbean became the second region to surpass the 30% mark,
    followed
    by the Europe and Northern America region in 2020.
</p>

<p>In 2020, the share of women in national parliaments was the highest in Australia and New Zealand (35.1%), followed by
    Latin America and the Caribbean (32.1%), Europe and Northern America (31%) and Central Asia (25.4%). The other
    regions
    were below the global average, significantly so in Western Asia (15.6%), Southern Asia (17.3%), South-Eastern Asia
    (20.4%) and Eastern Asia (21.6%). Moreover, although minor improvements have been noted over time, the lowest share
    of
    women in parliament, 6.2%, continues to be in the <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span> region, excluding Australia
    and New Zealand.</p>

<!-- Add Figure 2 here -->

<p><strong>To a large extent such progress is the result of the introduction of targeted policy and legal measures to
        increase
        women’s representation in national parliaments.</strong> Countries that have adopted special measures generally
    have higher
    numbers of women in parliament. While in 1995 only two countries had adopted legislation ensuring gender quotas<a
        aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn7"></a> for
    parliamentary elections (Argentina and Nepal), by 2020 over 80 countries had done so.<a
        aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn8"></a> In 2019, overall, women won
    25.8%
    of seats in 68 parliamentary chambers up for renewal in 55 countries.<a aria-describedby="footnote-label"
        href="#fn9"></a> In the 40 chambers that applied quotas –
    either
    legislated or voluntarily applied by political parties – women gained, on average, 30.3% of seats. In the remaining
    28
    chambers, which did not apply any form of quota, only 17.9% of seats were won by women.</p>

<p>Other key factors include policies to promote women’s recruitment by political parties, strong women’s movements,
    including women’s youth groups, awareness-raising efforts and a more gender-sensitive political culture.</p>

<p><strong>Over the past 25 years, the top countries in terms of women’s participation in parliament have become a much
        more
        diverse group.</strong> In 1995, 8 out of the 10 top-ranking countries were located in Europe (the other two
    being in Africa and
    Latin America). <strong>In 2020, the group included five countries from the <span class="label-ref">Latin America
            and the Caribbean</span>
        region</strong>, two
    European countries, two countries 2 from sub-Saharan Africa and one country from the Northern Africa and Western
    Asia
    region (see table 1).</p>

<p>In 2020, only four countries have thus far reached or surpassed the parity line of 50% representation by women in
    parliament: Rwanda (61.3%), Cuba (53.2%), Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (53.1%) and the United Arab Emirates
    (50.0%).
    Women’s representation in eight countries followed closely: Mexico (48.2%), Nicaragua (47.3%), Sweden (47.0%),
    Grenada
    (46.7%), Andorra (46.4%), South Africa (46.3%), Finland (46.0%) and Costa Rica (45.6%).<a
        aria-describedby="footnote-label" href="#fn10"></a></p>

<!-- Add Table 1 here -->

<p>
    Few women in politics reach the higher echelons of parliamentary hierarchies, particularly at the top levels as
    president or speaker of the house. Once elected, women parliamentarians need to hold positions of power and
    authority
    and participate in committee work if they are to influence policy direction. They also need to be positive role
    models
    for other women, work to change parliamentary procedures and, ultimately, support women’s rights and pursue gender
    equality (see table 2). Between 1995 and 2020, the percentage of female presiding officers of parliament almost
    doubled,
    from 10.5% to 20.5%, although this level of representation is still too low to influence policy-making effectively
    (figure III).

<p>
    <strong>Women are acutely underrepresented in key decision-making positions in parliaments in relation to their
        overall
        share of
        nearly 25% of parliamentary seats.</strong> Available data for 2020 shows a contrasting picture of women’s
    leadership of
    parliamentary committees. Women currently chair 26% of foreign affairs, defence, finance, human rights and gender
    equality committees combined, but their share varies significantly by committee type, from 73% of gender equality
    committees to just over 10% of defence committees. Data for the reporting period show that women chair approximately
    33%
    of human rights committees, 20% of foreign affairs committees and 13% of finance committees (see figure IV).

<h1>Legislative environment</h1>

<p>
    Article 25 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights recognizes “the right and opportunity,
    without
    distinction of any kind such as (...) sex (...) to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through
    freely
    chosen representatives”.
    Article 7 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women provides that “States
    Parties shall (...) ensure to women, on equal terms with men, the right: (a) To vote in all elections and public
    referenda
    and to be eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies; (b) To participate in the formulation of government
    policy and the implementation thereof and to hold public office and perform all public functions at all levels of
    government.”

<h1>Countries in focus</h1>
<p>
    Over the last 25-year span, from 1995 to 2020, the most significant progress in the achievement of women’s equal
    representation in parliament has been made in Rwanda (+ 57%), the United Arab Emirates (+50%), Andorra (+ 42.8%) and
    the
    Plurinational State of Bolivia (+42.3%), respectively, in their lower or single houses. In 1995, the top country
    (Sweden) had 40% of seats held by women in parliament. In 2020, in the top country (Rwanda), over 60% of seats in
    the
    lower house are held by women.
