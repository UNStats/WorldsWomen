<ul class="key-points">
    <li>In 2020, women are free under the law to participate in political activity in all countries worldwide, although
        significant obstacles to their effective access to parliament remain, including: gender stereotypes; unequal
        access to
        resources and education; unequal social and legal status; and violence and harassment perpetrated against women
        in
        politics and women aspirants to political office.</li>

    <li>Despite these challenges, there has been a continuous improvement in women’s access to parliament, with slow but
        steady
        progress in representation over the past 25 years. From 1995 to 2020, the proportion of parliamentary seats held
        by
        women rose from 11.3% to 24.9%. Improvement appears to have slowed down, however, since 2015 – and currently, in
        2020,
        women hold at least 50% of the seats in only four national parliaments.</li>

    <li>From the regional perspective, major milestones have been achieved in recent years in Australia and New Zealand,
        Latin
        America and the Caribbean and Europe and Northern America. However, Oceania, excluding Australia and New
        Zealand,
        continues to lag behind, with only 6% of parliamentary seats being held by women.</li>

    <li>To a large extent such progress is the result of the introduction of targeted policy and legal measures to
        increase
        women’s representation in national parliaments. Of the 20 countries with the highest percentages of women in
        parliament,
        16 apply some type of gender quota.</li>

    <li>Few women in politics reach the higher echelons of parliamentary hierarchies, particularly at the top levels as
        president or speaker of the house. Although the percentage of female presiding officers of parliament almost
        doubled,
        from 10.5% in 1995 to 20.5% in 2020, it is still too low to influence policymaking effectively.</li>

    <li>Women continue to be underrepresented in key decision-making positions in parliaments, with the exception of
        gender
        equality committees, 73% of which are chaired by women.</li>
