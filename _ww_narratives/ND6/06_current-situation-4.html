<p><strong>Over the past 25 years, the top countries in terms of women’s participation in parliament have become a much
        more
        diverse group.</strong> In 1995, 8 out of the 10 top-ranking countries were located in Europe (the other two
    being in Africa and
    Latin America). <strong>In 2020, the group included five countries from the <span class="label-ref">Latin America
            and the Caribbean</span>
        region</strong>, two
    European countries, two countries 2 from sub-Saharan Africa and one country from the Northern Africa and Western
    Asia
    region (see table 1).</p>

<p>In 2020, only four countries have thus far reached or surpassed the parity line of 50% representation by women in
    parliament: Rwanda (61.3%), Cuba (53.2%), Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (53.1%) and the United Arab Emirates
    (50.0%).
    Women’s representation in eight countries followed closely: Mexico (48.2%), Nicaragua (47.3%), Sweden (47.0%),
    Grenada
    (46.7%), Andorra (46.4%), South Africa (46.3%), Finland (46.0%) and Costa Rica (45.6%).<span
