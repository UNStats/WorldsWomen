<p>Female genital mutilation is a violation of the human rights of girls and women that affects girls and women
    worldwide.
    There is a large body of literature documenting the adverse health consequences of female genital mutilation over
    both
    the short and long term: the practice is a direct manifestation of gender inequality, which “constitutes
    irreparable,
    irreversible harm and is an act of violence against women and girls”.<span class="footnote-index">6</span></p>

<p>While the practice is most concentrated in countries in Africa, from the Atlantic coast across to the Horn of Africa,
    it
    is also practiced in countries in the Middle East, such as Iraq and Yemen, in some countries in Asia, and also in
    some
    communities in Australia, Europe and Northern America.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
