<p>Based on available data, Ghana has made a significant improvement in the lives of women: the majority of women visit
    health-care facilities for childbirth and have access to the assistance of skilled personnel at the time of
    delivery.</p>

<p>In 2003, Ghana introduced a delivery fee exemption policy for women giving birth (rolled out to all regions in April
    2005), and in 2008 the Government introduced free national health insurance for pregnant women. Furthermore, free
    maternal health care services have been provided in Ghana since 2008 and community health-based planning services
    have
    been established at the district level all over the country. Additional evidence is needed, however, to confirm that
    free maternal health care has increased the overall use of skilled delivery providers by pregnant women.</p>

<p>More needs to be done to improve awareness of the availability of free maternal health care, so that every pregnant
    woman, irrespective of wealth, education, place of residence or traditional norms and beliefs, will be aware of her
    ability to visit the hospital or health-care facility for antenatal care and to receive skilled medical assistance
    there
    at the time of her delivery.
