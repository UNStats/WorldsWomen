<h1>Current situation</h1>
<p>
    Skilled medical assistance is essential to safe delivery. In Ghana, the proportion of pregnant women giving birth
    with
    the assistance of a skilled professional has increased, from 44% in 1998 to 74% in 2014 (see figure). Nevertheless,
    in
    2014, 26% of women in the country delivered without such assistance.</p>

<p><strong>During the period from 1998 to 2014, there was a 30 percentage point increase in the proportion of deliveries
        at health
        facilities</strong> as a result of improvements in the health sector brought about through the efforts of the
    Government and the
    Ghana Health Service.
