<h1>Legislative quotas can be strong drivers for gender balance in boardrooms</h1>

<p>A 2019 study<span class="footnote-index">2</span> revealed a similar trend of female representation
    on
    corporate boards in 23 out of 49 developed countries
    with available data (figure III).<span class="footnote-index">3</span> Overall, female
    representation on
    boards has been growing, although not fast enough.
    Over the last five years, the growth rate was faster in developed countries (9.1%) than in emerging economies (5%).
    According to another report, at the current pace the goal of 30% of womenâ€™s representation on boards will not be
    reached
    until 2029.<span class="footnote-index">4</span></p>
