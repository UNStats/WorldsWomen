<h1>Legislative quotas can be strong drivers for gender balance in boardrooms</h1>

<p>Government intervention has proven to be an effective method for improving gender diversity on corporate boards.
    Before
    2010, the proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies in the countries of the <span
        class="label-ref">European
        Union</span>
    was steady. In 2010, the European Commission recommended the adoption of legislative action to set a gender target
    on
    boards. Since 2010, the average proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies has doubled, from
    11.9% in 2010, to 28.8% in 2019.</p>

<p>Of the 11 countries with over 30% of female board members, five had implemented
    legislative quotas. The proportion of women on boards has gone up by 25.8% in the five countries with legislative
    quotas
    compared to a 16.9% overall increase in the 28 countries of the European Union. This difference is striking when
    compared to countries without quotas or that have taken no action at all, where there was only a 4.1% increase in
    women’s representation over the same nine-year period. Less dramatic improvements have been observed in countries
    using
    soft measures, or non-binding quotas, where women’s representation on boards increased by 13.2% over the same time
    period (see figure II).</p>
