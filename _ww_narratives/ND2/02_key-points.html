<ul class="key-points">
    <li>In 2019, one country in the European Union had surpassed the target of 40% of women on corporate boards
        recommended by the European Commission, and four other countries in the European Union came close, with shares
        above 35%.</li>
    <li>Government intervention has proven to be an effective method for improving gender diversity on corporate boards.
        Since the European Commission recommended the adoption of legislative action to set a gender target for board
        membership in 2010, the average proportion of women on the boards of the largest listed companies in the
        European Union has doubled (from 11.9% in 2010 to 28.8% in 2019).</li>
    <li>In those countries in the European Union with legislative quotas, women&rsquo;s representation on boards
        increased by 20 percentage points more than in countries without quotas or related actions.</li>
    <li>Overall, female representation on corporate boards has been growing, particularly in developed countries,
        although not fast enough: at the current pace, the goal of 30% of women&rsquo;s representation on boards will
        not be reached until 2029.</li>
    <li>The representation of women on corporate boards varies across economic sectors. In 2019, the financial sector
        had the highest proportion of companies with at least three women on their boards (45%) while the industrial
        sector had the largest proportion of companies without female representation at the board level (25%), as was
        also the case in the information technology (22%) and communications services sectors (22%).</li>
    <li>The &ldquo;glass wall&rdquo; phenomenon, which keeps women in support management positions rather than allowing
        them access to strategic management functions, still exists at the board level.</li>
    <li>While the share of female participation in the boardroom has increased, boards remain largely chaired by men,
        and in 2018 the share of female board chairs was less than 10% in almost all regions. Even in Europe, where the
        majority of legislative quotas on female board membership have been implemented, only 6.9% of board chairs are
        women.</li>
    <li>Data from 2018 show that, across regions, companies with female rather than male board chairs have a
        significantly higher number of women on their boards. The same phenomenon was found to apply at companies with a
        female Chief Executive Officer.</li>
