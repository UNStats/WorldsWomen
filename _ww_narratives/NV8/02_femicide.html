<h1>Femicide, the most extreme expression of violence against women</h1>
<p>Structural discriminatory, violent and patriarchal cultural patterns sustain gender inequality in the Latin America
    and
    the Caribbean region. Despite progress over recent decades, gender-based discrimination and violence against women
    remains a serious problem, which manifests itself in various areas and in multiple forms. <a href=#NV7
        class="narrative-ref">Femicide</a><span class="footnote-index">1</span>,
    described as the most dramatic and extreme form of violence against women, represents an attack on women and their
    human
    rights on a daily or exceptional basis in two settings: (a) violence in relationships, whether in a union or not
    (intimate femicide); and (b) violence inflicted by other persons, whether relatives, people from a womanâ€™s social
    environment or strangers, which may derive from situations of social conflict or crime.</p>
