<p>The entry of women judges into judiciary positions from which they have historically been excluded has been a
    positive
    step in ensuring that judiciaries are perceived as being more inclusive and representative of the people whose lives
    they serve and affect. By their mere presence, women judges enhance the legitimacy of courts, sending a powerful
    signal
    that they are open and accessible to those who seek recourse to justice.</p>
<p>Women judges contribute much more than
    improving gender balance within the judiciary, they also contribute significantly to the quality of decision-making,
    and
    thus to the quality of justice itself.<span class="footnote-index">1</span></p>
