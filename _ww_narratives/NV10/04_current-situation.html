<p>Data on judges and magistrates are collected in the United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal
        Justice Systems, which is issued every second year by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Over the
        past
        decade, the proportion of women judges or magistrates has increased steadily year after year, at an average of
        approximately half a percentage point (0.54%). In 2017, the share of women judges was estimated to be 40%, up
        from 35%
        in 2008 (figure I). If recent trends continue, the share of female judges will reach parity (50%) by 2035.</p>
