        <li><span class="definition">Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 5.2.1.</span> measures the percentage
            of
            ever-partnered women and girls who have
            experienced physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the
            previous 12
            months. While physical and sexual intimate partner violence are generally well defined and measured, this is
            not the
            case with psychological partner violence, which may be conceptualized differently across cultures and in
            different
            contexts. Therefore, this indicator currently reports on the global level of physical and/or sexual intimate
            partner
            violence only. A majority of data come from demographic and health surveys, which typically sample only
            women and girls
            aged 15-49. There is a lack of consistency in the age range of sample populations across country surveys: in
            the case of
            surveys that interview a sample of women and girls from a different age group, the prevalence for data on
            the 15-49 age
            group is often published or can be calculated from available data. The global indicator therefore currently
            reports
            violence experienced by ever-partnered women and girls 15-49 years of age.

        <li><span class="definition">Physical violence</span> consists of acts aimed at physically hurting the victim
            and include, but are not limited to, pushing, grabbing, twisting
            the arm, pulling the hair, slapping, kicking, biting or hitting with the fist or object, trying to strangle
            or
            suffocate, burning or scalding on purpose and/or threatening or attacking with some sort of weapon, gun or
            knife.
        </li>
        <li><span class="definition">Sexual violence</span> is defined as any sort of harmful or unwanted sexual
            behaviour that is imposed on someone. It includes acts of abusive
            sexual contact, forced engagement in sexual acts, attempted or completed sexual acts without consent, incest
            and/or
            sexual harassment. In intimate partner relationships, experiencing sexual violence is commonly defined as
            being forced
            to have sexual intercourse, having sexual intercourse out of fear for what the partner might do and/or being
            forced to
            so something sexual that the woman or girl considers humiliating or degrading.</li>
