<p>Since 2010, among countries with comparable data (47 countries),<span class="footnote-index">4</span> the proportion
    of women and girls experiencing
    intimate
    partner physical or sexual violence in the past 12 months ranged from 3.5% in Armenia (2015â€“2016) to 46.1% in
    Afghanistan (2015).</p>
<p>Some issues with comparability persist owing to historical data related to age ranges used in different surveys.
    Putting
    these differences to one side, available data for the 112 countries up to 2018 show that the proportion of women
    experiencing intimate partner physical or sexual violence in the past 12 months ranged from 2.0% in Spain (2012) and
    Slovenia (2012) to a rate of 46.1% in Afghanistan (2015).</p>
