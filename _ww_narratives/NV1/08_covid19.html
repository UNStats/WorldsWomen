<p>The lockdowns resulting from the <span class="label-ref">COVID-19</span> pandemic have confined many women and girls
    to their homes, sometimes
    with
    abusive partners, putting them at greater risk of domestic violence. Reports from several countries reveal an
    increase
    in reported cases of domestic violence to helplines, womenâ€™s shelters and the police. In some countries, however,
    there
    has been a decrease in the number of reported incidents of domestic violence, possibly owing to the fact that women
    and
    girls confined in the home with an abusive partner have limited privacy and may lack <a href=#NW25
        class="narrative-ref"></a>access to mobile phones or to
    the
    Internet</a>, making it difficult for them to reach out for help.</p>
</p>
<p>While as yet there is no solid evidence on
    the impact of COVID-19 on the percentage of women and girls subjected to intimate partner violence, past evidence
    has
    shown that violence is more severe and frequent for those already in abusive relationships when intimate partners
    spend
    more time at home (for example, during the holidays); it is not perceived as a corollary, however, that more men are
    becoming first-time perpetrators. While robust statistics on the impact of COVID-19 are still being produced, there
    are
    reasons to believe that the pandemic is likely to increase the risk that women may experience different forms of
    violence, specifically intimate partner domestic violence: 15 years of survey data show that the great majority of
    women
    survivors of violence never report it to the police, helplines or other service providers.
