    included in the population covered by surveys on the topic. One country that reports on violence against senior
    women is Canada, where risk of being the victim of a violent crime generally decreases with age. As a reflection of
    this overall pattern, seniors had the lowest rates of police-reported violent crime, regardless of whether violence
    was perpetrated by a family member or someone outside the family network. However, senior victims of family violence
    are more likely to sustain injuries than other victims of family violence.<span class="footnote-index"><a

    suggest that, as women age, they are at greater risk of experiencing violence at the hands of their grown children
    while still at risk of violence from their domestic partners. In 2010, 36% of perpetrators of violence against
    seniors aged 65&ndash;69 were their grown children, followed by their spouses (30%).</p>

<p>Data on the prevalence of violence against women and girls is often lacking for women and girls with disabilities,
    ethnic minorities, migrant workers and older women. Even where such data exist, comparability between countries and
    within countries remains challenging.</p>
