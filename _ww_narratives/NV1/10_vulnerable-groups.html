<h1>Vulnerable groups</h1>

<p>
    Rates of domestic violence against <span class="label-ref">indigenous women</span> are often significantly higher
    than the rest of the
    population.
    Surveys to measure violence against women must include these populations in order to ensure no one is left behind.
    In
    2016, in analysis carried out by the Domestic Violence Resource Centre in the Australian state of Victoria<span
        class="footnote-index">5</span> it was
    reported that Aboriginal women are 34 times more likely to be hospitalized from family violence<span
        class="footnote-index">6</span> and almost 11 times
    more
    likely to be <a href=#NV7 class="narrative-ref">killed</a> as a result of violent assault.
