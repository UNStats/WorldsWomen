<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    Violence against women and girls is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and Intimate partner violence, is
    the
    most common form of violence faced by women and girls worldwide. One in three women will experience physical and/or
    sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in her life.<span class="footnote-index">1</span> Given
    prevailing social norms that sanction male
    dominance over women, violence between intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary and/or normal element of
    relationships, particularly in the context of marriage or other unions.</p>
<p>Based on the latest available data for 112 countries during the period from 2005 to 2018, it is estimated that,
    worldwide, 18% of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15â€“49 have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate partner
    violence during the previous 12 months. Based on data from 112 countries, 14% of women have experienced physical
    violence and 6% of women have experienced sexual violence at the hands of intimate partners during the previous 12
    months. As shown in figure I, this proportion varies widely across regions and countries.
