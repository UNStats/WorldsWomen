    A survey carried out in Europe in 2019, led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and
    covering seven countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, found that 6.7%<span class="footnote-index">2</span>
    of women had been subjected to
    physical or
    sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months. Prevalence rates over the
    12-month
    period ranged from 3.1% in Republic of North Macedonia to 9.4% in the Republic of Moldova. </p>

<p>Although many countries
    collect information on violence against women, direct comparisons are difficult to make because of differences in
    data
    collection methodology.<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In particular, some developed countries regularly
    publish statistics on intimate partner
    violence based on victimization surveys and complement these statistics with the number of cases reported to the
    police
    in order to measure prevalence of violence as well as coverage of reported cases.</p>
