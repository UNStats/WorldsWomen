<p>A survey carried out in Europe in 2019, led by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and
    covering seven countries in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, found that 6.7%<span class="footnote-index"><a
            data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">2</a></span> of women had been
    subjected to physical or sexual violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months.
    Prevalence rates over the 12-month period ranged from 3.1% in Republic of North Macedonia to 9.4% in the Republic of
    Moldova.</p>

<p>Although many countries collect information on violence against women, direct comparisons are difficult to make
    because of differences in data collection methodology.<span class="footnote-index"><a
            data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">3</a></span> In particular, some
    developed countries regularly publish statistics on intimate partner violence based on victimization surveys and
    complement these statistics with the number of cases reported to the police in order to measure prevalence of
    violence as well as coverage of reported cases.</p>
