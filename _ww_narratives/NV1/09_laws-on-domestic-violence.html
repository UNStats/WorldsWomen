<h1>
    Laws on domestic violence
</h1>
<p>
    As of 2020, at least 153 countries have passed laws on domestic violence. Developed countries, including countries
    in
    Latin America and the Caribbean, Eastern and South-Eastern Asia and Oceania, have the highest coverage, with over
    90% of
    countries in these regions having laws on domestic violence: this stands in stark contrast to the situation in
    countries
    in sub-Saharan Africa and Northern and Western Asia, less than 65% of which have specifically criminalized domestic
    violence.</p>
