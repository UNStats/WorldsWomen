<h1>Laws on domestic violence</h1>

<p>As of 2020, at least 153 countries have passed laws on <a href=#NV1 class="narrative-ref">domestic violence</a>, 106
    have laws on sexual
    harassment and 45 have laws on marital rape. As shown in figure I, developed countries as well as countries in <span
        class="label-ref">Latin
        America and the Caribbean</span>, <span class="label-ref">Eastern and South-Eastern Asia</span> and <span
        class="label-ref">Oceania</span> have the highest coverage; over 90% of
    countries
    in those regions have laws on domestic violence. This is in stark contrast to the situation in countries in
    <span class="label-ref">sub-Saharan
        Africa</span> and <span class="label-ref">Northern Africa and Western Asia</span>, where less than 65% have laws
    specifically criminalizing domestic
    violence.</p>
