<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    Not all countries have laws criminalizing or containing provisions on violence against women, and when such laws are
    in
    place, authorities are often more focused on responding to cases of domestic violence through criminal justice
    processes
    rather than on ways of preventing its occurrence by providing support and resources to women at risk of abuse.
    Furthermore, even when domestic violence laws exist, they are not necessarily implemented, or implemented in a form
    that
    helps the victims in substantive ways.</p>
<p>In many cases, victims of domestic violence are economically dependent on their
    intimate partners and the conviction and/or imprisonment of perpetrators often leaves victims deprived of their one
    source of economic support. In the light of these factors, domestic violence laws need to be implemented in tandem
    with
    measures for the economic empowerment of women, including, in particular, appropriate social support mechanisms for
    those who take the difficult step of seeking legal recourse.</p>
