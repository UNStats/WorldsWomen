<p><strong>High levels of women’s representation have been reached, in the majority of cases, by means of legislated
                quotas</strong></p>


<p>The use of legislated gender quotas has increased women’s representation in local governments, particularly in
        developing regions. Legislated gender quotas are temporary special measures provided for in national legal
        frameworks
        for the purpose of correcting historical trends in numerical gender imbalance and fast tracking the increased
        representation of women.</p>

<p>Worldwide, countries with legislated quotas have higher levels of women’s
        representation in
        local government (by 7% on average) compared to those without quotas.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>
        Increases resulting from the adoption of
        quotas
        are higher in countries in developing regions (11%), particularly in countries in sub-Saharan Africa (16%) and
        Northern
        Africa and Western Asia (13%).</p>
