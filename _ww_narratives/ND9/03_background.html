<p><strong>Women’s access to local government positions is a right and a necessary condition for ensuring the inclusion
        of women’s interests and perspectives in local decision-making</strong></p>

<p>Women’s rights to political participation on equal terms with men and to shared power between women and men in
    decision-making bodies at all levels of government have been recognized in international normative frameworks<span
        class="footnote-index">1</span> and
    emphasized in the Beijing Platform for Action.<span class="footnote-index">2</span></p>

<p>While the majority of research
    and global data collection on women’s representation in decision-making positions has been
    focused on national parliaments, the inclusion of women in local governments positions
    in the SDG monitoring framework acknowledges the importance of a whole-of-government approach to
    sustainable development and of women’s voices and leadership at the local as well as the national levels of
    government.</p>
