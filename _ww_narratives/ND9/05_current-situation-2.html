<p><strong>Women’s representation in local deliberative bodies varies widely across and within regions</strong></p>
<p>Women’s representation is highest in countries in the
    <span class="label-ref">Central and Southern Asia</span> (41%) and
    <span class="label-ref">Europe and Northern America</span> (35%) regions,
    driven, in particular, by high levels of women’s representation in countries with large
    numbers of councillors, such as
    <span class="label-ref">France</span> and
    <span class="label-ref">India</span>, while lowest in countries in the
    <span class="label-ref">Northern Africa and Western Asia</span>
    (18%) region (see figure II).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are countries with gender-balanced local deliberative bodies in almost all regions. Women’s
    representation is over 40%, for example, in: Antigua and Barbuda (67%) and Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (50%) in
    Latin America and the Caribbean; Belarus (48%) and Iceland (47%) in Europe; Uganda (46%) in Africa; New Caledonia
    (46%)
    in Oceania; and India (44%) in Central and Southern Asia.</p>
