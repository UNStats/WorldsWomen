<ul class="key-points">
    <li>Acceptance of wife-beating is generally higher in countries in Africa, Asia and Oceania, excluding Australia and
        New
        Zealand, and lower in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe.</li>
    <li>Intimate partner violence is becoming less acceptable. During the 8-year period from 2012 to 2019, womenâ€™s
        acceptance of
        physical violence by their partners decreased in almost 75% of countries with trend data.</li>
    <li>Younger men view physical violence against their partners as more acceptable than older men.</li>
    <li>Although it may be assumed that wife-beating is more widely justified by men than women, in the 53 countries
        with data
        on the attitudes of women and men, reported acceptance rates were actually lower among men than women in 40
        countries.</li>
