    Evidence also suggests that attitudes are changing. In 2019, women generally viewed domestic violence as being less
    acceptable than they had in 2012. Between 2012 and 2019, 15 countries conducted multiple surveys and provided
    multiple
    data points for trend analysis on womenâ€™s attitudes towards physical violence: in 11 countries levels of acceptance
    of
    wife-beating had decreased, while in the other 4 countries levels of acceptance had increased.
