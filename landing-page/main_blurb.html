<h4 style="text-align: left;">The World’s Women 2020 covers eight critical areas of policy concern: population and
    families, health, education, work, power and decision-making, violence against women, environment, and poverty. In
    each area, a life-cycle approach is introduced to reveal the experiences of women and men during different periods
    of life—from childhood and the formative years, through the working and reproductive stages, to older ages.</h4>
