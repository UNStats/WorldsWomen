    At the 1995 United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women, Governments adopted the Beijing Declaration
    and Platform for Action, which “seeks to promote and protect the full enjoyment of all human rights and the
    fundamental freedoms of all women throughout their life cycle.”
</p>
<blockquote>
    <em>
        The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of 1995 is a visionary agenda for the empowerment of
        women. It still remains today the most comprehensive global policy framework and blueprint for action, and is a
        current source of guidance and inspiration to realize gender equality and the human rights of women and girls,
        everywhere.
    </em>
</blockquote>
<p class="lead">
    The Platform for Action covers <strong>12 critical areas of concern</strong> that are as relevant today
    as 20 years ago: poverty; education and training; health; violence; armed conflict; economy; power and
    decision-making; institutional mechanisms; human rights; media; environment; and the girl child.
</p>
<p class="lead">
    For each critical area of concern, <strong>strategic objectives</strong> are identified, as well as a
    detailed catalogue of related <strong>actions</strong> to be taken by Governments and other stakeholders, at
    national,regional and international level.
