        <li id="fn3">In general, while rape laws (except where the exemption of a spouse is explicitly stated) do not
            preclude a spouse from
            being prosecuted, data refer to instances where laws explicitly criminalize marital rape without
            qualifications, for
            example, by providing that sexual assault provisions apply irrespective of the nature of the relationship
            between the
            perpetrator and complainant, or that no marriage or other relationship shall constitute a defense against a
            charge of
            sexual assault under the law. In other instances, a marital (or equivalent) relationship may be explicitly
            cited in the
            law as an aggravating factor. Explicit criminalization of marital rape is recommended as best practice by,
            among other
            bodies, the Council of Europe. (⇡ back to
