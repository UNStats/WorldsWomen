    In some countries of the region, in the majority of instances, the murders of women are cases of femicide. For
    example,
    in <span class="label-ref">El Salvador</span>, three out of five murders of women were recorded as femicides in 2018
    – in other words, 60%
    involved
    a component of “hate or contempt for women”, as codified in article 45 of the comprehensive Law for a Life Free of
    Violence against Women passed by the legislature in 2011.</p>

<p><strong>In most countries of the region, 25% to 33% of women have
        experienced an episode of physical or sexual violence inflicted by a partner.</strong> Those figures are higher
    in certain
    countries, such as the Bolivia (Plurinational State of) (58.5%), Colombia (33.3%), Costa Rica (35.8%) and Ecuador
    (35.5%), where data show that more than one third of women have been subjected to <a href=#NV1

        intimate partner</a>.
