<p>As of December 2018, 34.6% of heads and 48% of deputy heads of United Nations peacekeeping and special political
        missions were women, a record number. In addition, in 2018, the Secretary-General appointed the first female
        Under
        Secretary-General for Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, and three female special envoys.<span

<p>Nevertheless,
        despite these
        appointments, the proportion of female staff in Field Services, who are generally recruited internationally to
        serve in
        a civilian capacity at field missions, was significantly lower (27%). Furthermore, in 2019, out of approximately
        95,000
        peacekeepers, women comprised only 4.7% of military personnel and 10.8% of police personnel at United Nations
        peacekeeping missions.<span class="footnote-index">7</span></p>
