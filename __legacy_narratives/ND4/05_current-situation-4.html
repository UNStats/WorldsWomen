<p>The achievement of the goal of gender parity has remained slow and uneven however. The representation of women
    continues
    to be higher at the junior professional levels<span class="footnote-index">3</span> (above 50%) and declines at
    higher senior professional and management
    levels<span class="footnote-index">4</span> (between 30% and 40%).</p>

<p>
    The most significant progress has been achieved at the highest levels of
    decision-making
    and responsibility,<span class="footnote-index">5</span> with a 40% representation of women â€“ a direct result of the
    commitment of the Secretary-General
    to
    reach parity at the highest levels by 2021. At the very top of the hierarchy, however, no woman has been appointed
    Secretary-General since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945.</p>
