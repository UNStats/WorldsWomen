<p>
    Chief statisticians are high-ranking administrators in charge of national statistical offices, which are responsible
    for
    producing official statistics in countries worldwide. As at 2 June 2020, 24% of national statistical offices (52 out
    of
    215) had a woman as chief statistician, very close to the proportion observed five years ago. As at 2020, in
    countries
    in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia, 39% of national statistical offices were headed by a female chief statistician
    (see
    figure II). </p>

<p>Over the past five years, there has been significant progress in Oceania (excluding Australia and New
    Zealand): in June 2020, national statistical offices in 7 out of 19 countries or areas in the region were headed by
    a
    woman, while in 2015 there were none.<span class="footnote-index">2</span> In contrast, there were no female chief
    statisticians of national statistical
    offices in Australia and New Zealand.
