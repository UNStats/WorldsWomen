<p><strong>Skilled assistance at birth is most common among highly <span class="label-ref">educated</span>
        women.</strong> Women with higher levels
    of education are
    consistently more likely to seek skilled assistance at childbirth (see table 2). The trend during the period
    1998â€“2014
    reveals that a large and growing majority of women with secondary education and higher give birth with the
    assistance of
    skilled health-care providers (from 86% in 1998 to 96% in 2014) and that women with middle school education are
    increasingly following suit (from 60% in 1998 to 83% in 2014). Data also show that double the proportion of women
    with
    no formal education, although less likely to use skilled health personnel, gave birth with skilled assistance (from
    25%
    in 1998 to 52% in 2014).</p>
