<p>According to available data, pregnant women in the highest <span class="label-ref">wealth</span> quintile, who can
    most easily pay hospital
    charges, are also the most likely to seek the assistance of skilled health personnel at the time of delivery. In
    terms
    of access to health care, differences according to levels of wealth are marked and persistent over time (see table
    4).
    In 2003, only 2 in 10 women in the lowest wealth quintile had access to skilled health personnel at the time of
    delivery, compared to 9 in 10 women in the highest quintile. By 2014, the proportion of women in the lowest quintile
    with access to skilled assistance had more than doubled (47%), although it was still far from equal.

    <strong>Overall, by
        2014,
        more than 90% of women in the two highest wealth quintiles had access to skilled health personnel during
        childbirth.</strong>
