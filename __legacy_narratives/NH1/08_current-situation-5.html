<p>In 2014, a large majority of pregnant women giving birth in urban areas (90%) received skilled care, as compared to
    women in <span class="label-ref">rural</span> areas (60%) (see table 3), an increase from 84% in urban areas and 43%
    in rural areas as reported in
    2008. The difference in proportion between rural and urban rates is largely because of the greater number of
    health-care
    facilities is concentrated urban areas and because pregnant women in rural areas must travel long distances to
    health
    facilities with skilled medical personnel.</p>
