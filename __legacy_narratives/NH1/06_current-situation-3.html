<p><strong>In 1998, <span class="label-ref">younger mothers</span> were more likely than older mothers to deliver their
        babies with the assistance of
        skilled
        health personnel, while by 2014 little difference was recorded by age.</strong> Data collected in 1998 show a
    marked
    difference
    in the proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel according to a woman’s age, a difference that has
    faded
    over time as more women have gained access to professional health care. By 2014, among women aged 15–49, the
    proportion
    of women giving birth with skilled medical assistance was above 70%, and the difference among age groups was
    negligible
    compared to previous years (see table 1).</p>
