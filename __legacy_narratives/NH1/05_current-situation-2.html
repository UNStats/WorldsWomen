<p>Despite the introduction of policies to address problems resulting from lack of access to skilled health personnel,
    some
    women are falling through the safety net; women who deliver their children at home are less likely to be able to
    obtain
    access to skilled care if complications occur during childbirth.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering at health facilities ensures skilled care during childbirth.</strong> According to the most recent
    survey, nearly
    3 in
    4 births occur at health facilities, primarily public sector health facilities: facility-based births are more
    common in
    urban settings (90%) than in rural areas (60%).<span class="footnote-index">3</span> In Ghana, more than a quarter
    of births occur at home: overall,
    almost 3
    in 4 births are attended by a skilled professional.<span class="footnote-index">4</span>
