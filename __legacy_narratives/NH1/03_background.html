<h1>Background</h1>

<p>
    Women’s access to skilled medical care, especially during childbirth, is a key strategy for the reduction of the
    maternal mortality ratio (MMR), that in Ghana still reaches 310 deaths per 100,000 live births.<span

</p>
<p>The most dangerous time in a woman’s pregnancy is during labour and delivery when the majority of maternal deaths
    occur.
    The presence of skilled medical attendants is essential for the timely management of complications that may arise
    during
    and after delivery: by providing important lifesaving intervention for both mothers and babies, skilled health
    personnel
    reduce the risk of maternal morbidity and long-lasting disability.</p>
