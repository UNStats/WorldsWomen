<h1>
    Interrelationships between corporate leadership and board diversity
</h1>
<p>
    Data from 2018 show that, across regions, companies with female rather than male board chairs have a significantly
    higher number of women serving on boards. For example, in Asia, the percentage of women on boards was 19.2% when the
    chair was a woman compared to 9.9% when the chair was a man. The same phenomenon was found in companies with a
    female
    Chief Executive Officer. The largest difference was seen in <span class="label-ref">North America</span>, where
    30.9% of board members were
    female
    when a woman was Chief Executive Officer, compared to only 17.4% when the Chief Executive Officer was a man (see
    figure
    VI).<span class="footnote-index">9</span> Furthermore, recent evidence showed that, when there is
    gender balance on boards, companies are more likely to
    have
    <a href=#ND1 class="narrative-ref">women in senior management and in top executive positions</a>.<span
