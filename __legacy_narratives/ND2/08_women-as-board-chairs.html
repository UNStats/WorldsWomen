<h1>
    Women as Board chairs: gender equality remains elusive
</h1>

<p>
    While the share of female participation on corporate boards has increased, boards in all the regions remain largely
    chaired by men. As noted in the above-mentioned ILO report, in 2018, over 76% of companies reported having a man as
    the
    chair of the board (among surveyed companies that have a board), and, when further investigating the presence of
    women
    as board chairs of large listed companies in selected countries, the report noted that the share is generally less
    than
    10%. Data compiled by the Deloitte Global Center for Corporate Governance in 2018, covering nearly 7,000 companies
    in 66
    countries, show that the proportion of female board chairs is less than 10% in almost all regions. Even in
    <span class="label-ref">Europe</span>,
    where the majority of legislative quotas on female board members have been implemented, only 6.9% of board chairs
    are
    women (see figure V).<span class="footnote-index">8</span>
