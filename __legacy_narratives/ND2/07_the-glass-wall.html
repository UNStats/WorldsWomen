<h1>The “glass wall” phenomenon: women are more likely to be non-executive directors on supervisory boards rather than
    executives on management boards</h1>

<p>
    As highlighted in the 2019 report of the International Labour Organization (ILO),<span
        class="footnote-index">6</span> while companies have been making
    efforts to place more women on boards, the roles of women on boards have not been emphasized enough and the “glass
    wall“
    phenomenon, which restricts women to support management positions rather than strategic management functions, is
    evident
    still at the board level. This is particularly apparent in companies with a two-tier board structure. Some countries
    have a mandatory two-tier structure: a management board and a supervisory board. The executive directors on the
    management board decide about the company’s objectives and implement the necessary measures, while the non-executive
    directors on the supervisory board monitor those decisions.<span class="footnote-index">7</span>
    Evidence presented in the above-mentioned report of ILO
    reveals that women are more likely to be non-executive than executive directors and on supervisory rather than
    management boards in countries with two-tier board systems (for example, in France and Germany).
