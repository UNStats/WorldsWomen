<h1>Current situation</h1>

<p>Globally, an increasing number of companies are using 30% as the gender balance target on corporate boards, following
    initiatives such as the “30% Club”, a campaign promoting greater female representation on corporate boards launched
    in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in 2010.<span class="footnote-index">1</span>
    Furthermore, in 2010, the European Commission
    suggested legislative action to set a gender target on boards, proposing a target of 40% of women’s representation
    on corporate boards in 2012.</p>

<p>In 2019, the highest percentage of female board members in the largest publicly listed companies in the <span
        class="label-ref">European Union</span> was found in France (45.3%), the only country reaching the 40% target
    suggested by the European Commission. Four other countries exceeded 35%, Sweden (37.5%), Italy (36.1%), Belgium
    (35.9%) and Germany (35.6%), with the latter three also surpassing their legislative quota targets. Overall, a total
    of 11 countries out of the 28 countries in the European Union (39%) had over 30% of women as board members of their
    largest publicly listed companies.Nevertheless, in 12 countries, women constituted less than a fifth of board
    members, and in 3 countries they represented less than 10% of board members: Cyprus (9.1%), Estonia (9.4%) and Malta
    (10%) (see figure I).</p>
