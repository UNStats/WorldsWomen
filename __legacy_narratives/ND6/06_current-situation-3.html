<p><strong>To a large extent such progress is the result of the introduction of targeted policy and legal measures to
        increase
        women’s representation in national parliaments.</strong> Countries that have adopted special measures generally
    have higher
    numbers of women in parliament. While in 1995 only two countries had adopted legislation ensuring gender quotas<span
        class="footnote-index">7</span> for
    parliamentary elections (Argentina and Nepal), by 2020 over 80 countries had done so.<span
        class="footnote-index">8</span> </p>
<p>In 2019, overall, women won
    25.8%
    of seats in 68 parliamentary chambers up for renewal in 55 countries.<span class="footnote-index">9</span> In the 40
    chambers that applied quotas –
    either
    legislated or voluntarily applied by political parties – women gained, on average, 30.3% of seats. In the remaining
    28
    chambers, which did not apply any form of quota, only 17.9% of seats were won by women.</p>

<p>Other key factors include policies to promote women’s recruitment by political parties, strong women’s movements,
    including women’s youth groups, awareness-raising efforts and a more gender-sensitive political culture.</p>
