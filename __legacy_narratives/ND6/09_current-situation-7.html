    <strong>Women are acutely underrepresented in key decision-making positions in parliaments in relation to their
        overall
        share of
        nearly 25% of parliamentary seats.</strong> Available data for 2020 shows a contrasting picture of womenâ€™s
    leadership of
    parliamentary committees. Women currently chair 26% of foreign affairs, defence, finance, human rights and gender
    equality committees combined, but their share varies significantly by committee type, from 73% of gender equality
    committees to just over 10% of defence committees. Data for the reporting period show that women chair approximately
    33%
    of human rights committees, 20% of foreign affairs committees and 13% of finance committees (see figure IV).
