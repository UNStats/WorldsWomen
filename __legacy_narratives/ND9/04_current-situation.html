<p><strong>Women are less likely than men to be employed and if employed are less likely to hold managerial
                positions.</strong></p>

        As at 1 January 2020, as shown in the data available for 133 countries and areas worldwide, women held 36% of
        elected
        seats in local deliberative bodies. While women’s representation at the local level was higher than in <a
                href=#ND6 class="narrative-ref">national
                parliaments</a> (25%),<span class="footnote-index">6</span> it was not yet close to
        parity.</p>

<p>Women’s
        representation in local deliberative
        bodies was
        at 40% or above in only a minority of countries (15%). In the majority of countries (53%), levels of women’s
        representation were reported at levels between 10% and 30%, and in 12% of countries women’s representation was
        less than
        10%, a distribution similar to that observed for women’s representation in national parliaments (see figure I).
