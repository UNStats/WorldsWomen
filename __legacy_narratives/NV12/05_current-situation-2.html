<p>Wife-beating remains acceptable in some countries throughout the world: reported levels of acceptance were generally
    higher in countries in <span class="label-ref">Africa</span>, <span class="label-ref">Asia</span> and <span
        class="label-ref">Oceania</span> (excluding Australia and New Zealand) and lower in
    countries
    in Latin America and the Caribbean and Europe. Levels of acceptance among women ranged from 2% in Uruguay (2013)
    to
    80%
    in <span class="label-ref">Afghanistan</span> (2015). Among men, levels of acceptance ranged from 4% in Colombia
    (2015) and the Dominican
    Republic
    (2013) to 72% in <span class="label-ref">Afghanistan</span> (2015) and <span class="label-ref">Papua New
        Guinea</span> (2017).</p>
<p>It should be noted that it is difficult to
    compare reported levels of acceptance of wife-beating across countries and contexts because willingness to talk
    about
    violence and attitudes towards it vary, a factor that can affect individual response rates. Although it might be
    assumed
    that wife-beating is more widely justified by men than women, in the 53 countries with data on the attitudes of
    both
    women and men, reported acceptance levels were actually lower among men than women in 40 countries.</p>
