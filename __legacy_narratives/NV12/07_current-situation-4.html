<p>Trend data on menâ€™s attitudes towards physical violence against women is not widely available, which makes comparable
    trend analysis challenging. It is possible, however, to look at the differences between the attitudes of
    <span class="label-ref">adolescents</span>
    and adult men to see whether attitudes differ across age groups within a given country. Worryingly, data suggest
    that
    young men view physical violence against women as more acceptable than older men whereas differences in attitudes by
    age
    are less pronounced among women (see table).
