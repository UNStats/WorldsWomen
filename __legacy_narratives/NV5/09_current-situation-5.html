<p>Progress
    has been extremely slow in Guinea and Somalia, where the practice remains almost universal and where at least 9 in
    10
    women and adolescent girls aged 15–19 years have been cut. Based on the latest available data, in six countries<span

    least
    3 out of every 4 women and adolescent girls aged 15–19 have undergone FGM, including in the Gambia where,
    worryingly,
    the prevalence of this harmful practice has increased compared with 30 years ago.

    Progress in the elimination of FGM is not universal, and where there is progress it is not fast enough. Even in
    countries where the practice has become less common, progress would need to be at least 10 times faster to meet the
    global target of its elimination by 2030.<span class="footnote-index">10</span></p>
