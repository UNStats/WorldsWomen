<p>Female genital mutilation is condemned in international treaties and conventions, including the Convention on the
        Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against
        Women
        and the Cairo Declaration for the Elimination of Female Genital Mutilation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since FGM is regarded
        as a
        traditional practice prejudicial to the health of children and is, in most cases, performed on minors, it
        violates the
        Convention on the Rights of the Child. In many countries national legislation includes an explicit ban on the
        practice.</p>
