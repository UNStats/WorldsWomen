<p>With its inclusion under Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 5.3, which is aimed at the elimination of this
    harmful practice by 2030, FGM holds a prominent position on the global development agenda. Although the practice has
    persisted for centuries, it is becoming less common, with a marked decline reported in countries such as Egypt where
    it
    was once universal, as well as in countries such as Kenya, where the practice is restricted to specific ethnic
    communities.</p>
<p>Such declines at the country level have contributed to a reduction in regional rates over the past 15 years. In
    <span class="label-ref">Northern Africa</span>, the proportion of adolescent girls aged 15â€“19 years who have
    undergone FGM or cutting decreased
    by
    17.5%, from 91.4% in 2004 to 73.9% in 2019. In <span class="label-ref">sub-Saharan Africa</span>, its prevalence
    decreased by 9.6%, from 34.5%
    to
    24.9%, over the same time period (see figure I).</p>
