<p>Violence against women and girls is an extreme manifestation of gender inequality and Intimate partner violence, is
    the most common form of violence faced by women and girls worldwide. One in three women will experience physical
    and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in her life.<span class="footnote-index"><a
            data-storymaps="MJ-ACTION-1598603710821" data-storymaps-type="navigate">1</a></span> Given prevailing social
    norms that sanction male dominance over women, violence between intimate partners is often perceived as an ordinary
    and/or normal element of relationships, particularly in the context of marriage or other unions.</p>

<p>Based on the latest available data for 112 countries during the period from 2005 to 2018, it is estimated that,
    worldwide, 18% of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15&ndash;49 have experienced physical and/or sexual intimate
    partner violence during the previous 12 months. Based on data from 112 countries, 14% of women have experienced
    physical violence and 6% of women have experienced sexual violence at the hands of intimate partners during the
    previous 12 months. As shown in figure I, this proportion varies widely across regions and countries.</p>
