<p>
    Survey data from 63 countries indicate that the prevalence of intimate partner violence generally decreases with
    age.
    Based on available data disaggregated by 5-year-age groups, <span class="label-ref">younger women</span> (aged
    15–19, 20–24 and 25–29) are at
    the
    greatest risk of experiencing intimate partner violence, although rates of intimate partner violence by broad age
    group
    vary widely across countries (see figure II).</p>
<p>Between 2005 and 2017, 36 countries conducted more than one survey to measure the prevalence of intimate partner
    violence in the 12 months prior to the survey. Evidence of the magnitude of change in the level of intimate partner
    violence is mixed, with 21 countries (58%) recording decreases in intimate partner violence and 10 countries (28%)
    recording increases. The trend was unclear in five countries (14%).
