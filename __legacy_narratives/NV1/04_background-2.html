<p>Regional differences in the rates of intimate partner violence persist, with women in the Pacific, Southern Asia and
    sub-Saharan Africa regions at greatest risk. In <span class="label-ref">Oceania</span>, excluding Australia and New
    Zealand, the 12-month
    prevalence rate for intimate partner violence was 35%. The rates of intimate partner violence in <span
        class="label-ref">Southern Asia</span>
    (23%)
    and <span class="label-ref">sub-Saharan Africa</span> (22%) were above the global average. In contrast, the
    prevalence rate of recent intimate
    partner violence is lower, although significant, in Latin America and the Caribbean, at an average of 12%, and lower
    still in Europe, where the 12-month prevalence rate is 6%.</p>
<p>Focusing on <span class="label-ref">Latin America and the Caribbean</span>, population-based evidence confirms that
    intimate partner violence
    against women remains a widespread public health and human rights problem, with a reported prevalence of physical or
    sexual intimate partner violence during the previous 12 months across countries ranging from 3% to 27% of women and
    girls.</p>
