<ul class="key-points">
    <li>Although higher proportions of women in decision-making roles in the private sector has a positive correlation
        to
        superior corporate profitability, the proportion of women in managerial positions remains low in both the public
        and
        private sectors.</li>

    <li>Globally, women held only 28% of managerial positions in 2019, with some regional variations, and in countries
        in
        Northern Africa and Western Asia and Central and Southern Asia the proportion barely reached 13%, a statistic
        that has
        not changed significantly over the past 20 years.</li>

    <li>Since 2000, while the proportion of women in managerial positions has increased in most regions, the rate of
        improvement
        is slight.</li>

    <li>The underrepresentation of women in management positions is even more visible at the higher levels of
        decision-making:
        48% of companies surveyed by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in 2018<span
            class="footnote-index">1</span> had at least one woman in
        senior
        management, but only 31% had women in top executive positions.</li>

    <li>Women CEOs or top managers are even more scarce: only 18% of enterprises surveyed by the World Bank had a woman
        CEO.</li>

    <li>Among Fortune 500 corporations, women accounted for only 7.4%, or 37 out of 500 CEOs. Despite the minor
        improvement from
        1998, when only 1 out of the top 500 corporations had a female CEO, the gender gap at the level of top corporate
        decision makers remains significant.</li>

    <li>The bigger the enterprise, the lower the chances of it having a woman CEO: over 26% of small enterprises
        surveyed by ILO
        in 2018 (employing 2 to 100 workers) had female CEOs, compared with 16% of large enterprises (employing more
        than 250
        workers).</li>

    <li>Enterprises with more women in their workforce are more likely to have a female CEO. Of the enterprises surveyed
        by ILO
        in 2018, enterprises with a gender balanced workforce were 15% more likely to have a female CEO; and enterprises
        with a
        predominantly female workforce (between 61% and 100%) were 22% more likely to have a female CEO.</li>
