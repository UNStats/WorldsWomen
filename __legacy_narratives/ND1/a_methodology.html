            ISCO-88. If disaggregated statistics were not available at the sub-major group level (two-digit level of
            ISCO), major
            group 1 of ISCO-88 and ISCO-08 was used as a proxy, and in such cases the indicator refers only to total
            management
            (including junior management).
