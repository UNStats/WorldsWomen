<p>
    This argument is also supported by the historical data on the number of female CEOs on the list of the Fortune
    500,<span class="footnote-index">11</span>
    which shows the largest corporations in the United States of America. While the list from 2020 has more female CEOs
    than
    ever before, women only account for 7.4% of the total number: only 37 out of 500 CEOs are women (see figure VII).

<p>While
    this shows an improvement from 1998, when only 1 out of the top 500 corporations had a female CEO, the gender gap
    remains significant and is even more pronounced than among large enterprises, where in 2018 the share of women CEOs
    was
    reported at 16% (figure VII).
