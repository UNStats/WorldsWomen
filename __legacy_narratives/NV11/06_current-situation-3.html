    Based on the latest available data, in 2017 in five European countries the share of women police officer was greater
    than 30% (Estonia, <span class="label-ref">Latvia</span>, Lithuania, the Netherlands and Sweden). Although the
    proportion of women police
    officers
    in those countries is higher than in other countries, there are still challenges in ensuring that women are
    represented
    at higher levels of management. The Nordic-Baltic Network of Policewomen continues to ask the question: why are
    women
    underrepresented in the top and middle management positions and in operational positions in the police force?<span
