<p>Women play a vital role in policing and contribute, as much as their male colleagues, to providing safe and inclusive
    communities. Female police officers act as role models for gender equality, inspiring women and girls to advocate
    for their own rights and to pursue careers in law enforcement. Moreover, female police officers provide a greater
    sense of security to women and children and improve access and support from law enforcement agencies to all members
    of the community.</p>
<p>Women police officers utilize a style of policing that relies less on physical force, are better at defusing
    potentially violent confrontations,are less likely to become involved in the use of excessive force and are more
    likely to respond effectively to violence against women.
